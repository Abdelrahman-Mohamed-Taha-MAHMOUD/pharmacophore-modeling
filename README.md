 The goal is to identify ligands that preferentially induce the transrepression pathway of GR activation, thereby retaining the anti-inflammatory effects while minimizing the metabolic side effects. This approach aims to develop safer anti-inflammatory therapies with fewer side effects compared to current glucocorticoid treatments.  The practical sessions outlined in the document aim to equip participants with the computational tools and techniques necessary to achieve this goal, using a combination of data mining, pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, docking, and drug profiling.
